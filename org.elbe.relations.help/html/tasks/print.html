<h1>Printing the items' content</h1>


<p>Printing the item's content means writing the content to a
text file for that you can process it further using a text processor.
By default, the content of the selected items is written to a simple
text file. Additionally, Relations comes with a second plugin that allows you
to print out the content to an OpenOffice writer document. OpenOffice is free
software you can download from
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">http://www.openoffice.org/</a>.
However, you can view OpenOffice writer documents using newer
versions of MS Office Word too.</p>

print out</span></p>


<p>To start printing out select an item in the Relations browser
and press <code>Ctrl+P</code>.
A dialog window is displayed where you can enter the name of the file
to which the item's content shall be written to. You can select the
scope
of items whose content will be printed out. The minimal scope is the
selected item's content only. The middle scope is to print out the
content of the selected item and all items related with the selected
one. The last option is to print out the whole database. This option,
however, is recommended only for small databases (up to 100 items)
because of the time needed for the print out.</p>


<p>The format of the content printed out is dependent on the item type.
Each item is printed as section. The section title is the item's title.
In case of term items, it's simply the text that makes up
the&nbsp;section body.&nbsp;For person items, the section body
is made of the
person's year of birth and death if indicated and the text. In case of
text items, the section body is formatted according the selected
bibliography style.</p>


<p>You can add an additional section containing the items the
respective item is related to by checking the <span style="font-style: italic;">Output</span> check box.</p>


<p>Clicking the <span style="font-style: italic;">Finish</span>
button will start the print out. If the task has finished, you can
select another item and iterate the print out step, thus adding further
item content to the document created in the first step.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Add further
item by iterating the print out action</span></p>


<p>You do not have to bother about duplicates. The print out
manager will remember the items written to the selected document and
will print out the content of further items only if they have not
printed out yet.</p>


<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Example</span>:
You want to print out four items A, B, C and D where B is related with
A and C whereas C is related with B and D: <code>A - B - C - D</code>.
You can print out the items A, B and C if you select B in the Relations
browser and initialize the print out with scope <span style="font-style: italic;">selected and related</span>.
Then, select item C and add another print out step with the same
settings. This will add exactly the missing item D to the print out
document.</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
It is possible to extend the application by providing additional print
out types, i.e. document types the item content shall be written to.
This can be done by providing a plug-in implementing the <a href="../reference/org_elbe_relations_printOut.html">org.elbe.relations.printOut</a>
extension
point.</p>
