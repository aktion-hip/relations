<h1>Reindexing the database</h1>


<p>The Relations application uses the Lucene search engine to provide
full text search capability. The search index is created and maintained
automatically when you create, edit and delete items. In some special
cases, however, the search index may get corrupted, thus, leading to
false or incomplete search results. In such situations you may reindex
the database. To achieve this, select the menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Utilities &gt; Reindex database...</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message window displayed informs you about the number of items
actually contained in the search index. If this number differs from the
number of items stored in the database according to the information
displayed in the status bar, this is a strong hint that the search
index is not up to date.</p>
<p>Index creation is quite efficient. The search engine needs about 10
seconds to index 1000 database entries. Therefore, indexing large data
sets should be no problem.</p>
