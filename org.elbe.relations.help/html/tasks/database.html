<h1>Database backup, restore and import</h1>


<p>The Relations application stores the entered information in an
embedded database. This means, the database lives in the same thread in
the memory as the application lives, it is started up when you start
the application and shuted down when you close the application.</p>


<p>By default, the data you create is stored in a database named
"default_db". However, you can create <a href="../tasks/data_source.html">new embedded databases</a>
to use them afterwards. Distinct from external databases you can delete embedded databases
you have created e.g. for testing purposes.</p>


<h3>Backup of an embedded database</h3>


<p>To make the data you enter persistent, the embedded databases
("default_db" and the embedded databases you
create) save their data in various folders in the file system. These
folders are subfolder of a folder&nbsp;named "data" which again is
contained in the&nbsp;application's workspace. By default, the
applications <a href="../concepts/workspace.html">workspace</a> is a folder named
"workspace" that is a subfolder of the folder where you placed the
Relations application.</p>

<p>A backup of such an embedded database is simply a zip archive of
such a folder created and stored somewhere in your file system or on
a backup medium.</p>

<p>You can create such a backup archive using the export wizard <i>Backup data</i>.
To do this, start the <b>Export...</b> wizard from the
<b>Data</b> menu and select <i>Backup data</i>. The dialog page
displayed after allows you to enter the Zip file where the embedded database
is backuped. Note: You're not allowed to overwrite an existing backup archive.</p>

<h3>Restoring the state of an embedded database</h3>

<p>Restoring the database state is the inverse process: The import wizard
overwrites the folder of an embedded database with a backuped copy of this
folder. Start the <b>Import...</b> wizard from the <b>Data</b> menu and
select <i>Restore data</i>.
Select the backup archive containing the database state you want to restore.
(Note that the archive has to contain a state of the database you are actually
working with.)
Most probably you want to synchronize the search index with the restored
state of the database, therefore, tick the according checkbox.</p>

<p>For that the restored database state becomes effective, the application has to
be restarted. Therefore, the application asks you to restart after the restore
has been completed.</p>


<h3>Importing the backuped contend of an embedded database</h3>

<p>Instead of restoring the state of an embedded database, you can use the backup of such a database
to import data to a different embedded database. This new database might be
managed by the same Relations application as well as a Relations application
running on a completely different computer. To do this, start the <b>Import...</b> wizard
from the <b>Data</b> menu and select <i>Import database</i>.</p>

<p><img src="../img/import_db.gif" alt="Import database" /></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Import wizard for database import.</p>

<p>Name the new database you want to create and fill with the content of the exportet database.
(Note: you can't choose the name of an existing database catalog.)
Then select the backup archive containing the exportet database.
Most probably you want to create a search index for the imported the database,
therefore, tick the according checkbox.
After clicking the "Finish" button, the application starts importing,
then changes to the imported database and creates the search index if requested.</p>
