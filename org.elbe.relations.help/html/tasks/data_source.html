<h1>Creating and connecting a different data source</h1>

<p>The Relations application stores the entered information in an
embedded database. You can create new embedded databases and delete
them afterwards. Furthermore, you can use an external RDBMS (relational
database management system) and connect to it.</p>

<h3>Creating a new embedded database</h3>

<p>The RDMBS used by&nbsp;default is an embedded Derby
database. The application creates and uses a database catalog&nbsp;named "default_db"
(see the application's status line).
You can create new storage place in embedded or external databases, see
<a href="../concepts/wizards.html">Wizards to create items and databases</a>.</p>

<h3>Delete the current embedded database</h3>

<p>You can delete any embedded database except of the
"default_db". To delete an embedded database, make it the current
database and select the menu entry <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data
&gt; Delete current database</span>. This will delete the
current database and switch to "default_db".<br />
Note: You can't delete storage place in an external database using this application.</p>

<h3>Connecting a different data source</h3>

<p>You can connect to an already existing database, either
embedded or external, using the dialog displayed after clicking <code>Ctrl-O</code>
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Data &gt; Open
Database</span>).</p>

<p><img src="../img/change_db.gif" alt="Connect to a different database"></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Open another database</span>
<p>You first have to select the RDBMS you want to connect to. The
Relations application comes with an embedded Derby database. If you
have installed a MySQL database, you can use this RDBMS to store the
item information as well.</p>

<p>If you chose the embedded database, you only have to select
the catalog (e.g. database) available.</p>

<p>Having chosen an external database, you have to provide the
information needed to connect to this database. You have to specify
where the RDBMS is installed (the <span style="font-style: italic;">host</span>),
the name of the database (i.e. the <span style="font-style: italic;">catalog</span>)
that is set up to store the item information within this RDBMS, the <span style="font-style: italic;">user name</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">password</span> that has
the right to access the information stored in this catalog. Be aware that you can connect to
an external database catalog only if this catalog has the appropriate database schema (see
<a href="../reference/db_schema.html">Database schema</a>).</p>

<p>The last information needed is the language of the content you
store in the database. This information is needed to select the
appropriate index for full text search. Available content languages are
English and German.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
It is possible to extend the application by providing
additional&nbsp;database configurations for that you can connect to
another external RDBMS.
This can be done by providing a plug-in
implementing&nbsp;the&nbsp;
<a href="../reference/org_elbe_relations_configuration.html">org.elbe.relations.configuration</a>
extension point.
