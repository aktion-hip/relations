<h1>Export to the Cloud</h1>

<p>The Relations application is now available as mobile app on Android.<br />
To read the Relations data on your mobile phone, you must first upload the data
created on your computer by the Relations application to the cloud.
In a second step, you can synchronize (i.e. download and install) your mobile app's data with data in the cloud.</p>
<p>For the initial transfer of the data, use the <em>full</em> synchronization option. After the initial upload, you can use the <em>incremental</em> data
synchronization. This option only transfers the changes made since the last synchronization.</p>

<p>For that you can upload to the cloud, you must first configure the access to your cloud provider. (<b>Utility -> Preferences... -> Cloud Configuration</b>)</p>

<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<p>Dropbox needs an access token. You can get this access token from within the Relations application (see <b>Help -> Cloud Configuration</b>).</p>
<p>To start the workflow, you have to call the displayed authorization URL. This will lead you to a login page on Dropbox.
Once you are logged into Dropbox, you will be presented with a screen to authorize the Relations application to access your Dropbox data.<br />
After you have approved, you will be redirected to a page displaying the application's access code.</p>
