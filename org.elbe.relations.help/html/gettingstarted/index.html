<h1>Getting started with Relations</h1>

<p>
The Relations application is a tool for knowledge management. It is a combination of a personal Wiki and an electronic slip box.
</p>

<p>
You can easily create items of three types (terms, texts and persons) and
set them in relation to other items already entered, thus creating a rich context for your items.
</p>

<p>The main tasks of the Relations application are
	<i><a href="creating_items.html">creating items</a></i> and
	<i><a href="creating_relations.html">relating items</a></i>
	(i.e. creating the item's context).
	The items and contexts created this way are fully editable. You can
	<a href="editing_items.html"><i>edit items</i></a> and
	<a href="editing_context.html"><i>manage the items' contexts</i></a>,
	i.e. add and delete relations. To achieve this in an efficient way, the application
	provides the following views:</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>Relations browser:</h3>

<p>The <a href="../concepts/relations_browser.html">Relations browser</a> is the area where an item is displayed
with all items it is related to. You can navigate (i.e. move the focus) through the items displayed
and make a related item central, thus displaying its relations and related items.<br/>
<b>Note:</b> You can navigate back and forth through your history using the browser's navigation history.
Press the <img border="0" src="../img/backward_nav.gif" alt="Left arrow icon" /> arrow on the workbench toolbar (or <code>Alt+Left Arrow</code>) to go back to the last visited item.
Pressing the <img src="../img/forward_nav.gif" alt="Right arrow icon" border="0" /> (or <code>ALT+Right Arrow</code>) will get you back to the item you started.
</p>

<h3>Selection views:</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="../concepts/selection_views.html">selection views</a> allow to select items of the different types
	(terms, texts and persons). Selected items can be made central (e.g. by
	double clicking) or you can drag'n drop a selected item to an item displayed
	in the relations browser, thus adding a new relation to the drop target.
</p>
<h3>Inspector view:</h3>
<p>The <a href="../concepts/inspector_view.html">Inspector view</a> is the area for fast editing. The inspector view shows title
and content of the focus item in the Relations browser. Dependent on the item type,
either title, content or both are editable.</p>

<h3>Support views</h3>
<p>
There are three support views helping you at your work.
<ul>
	<li>Use the <a href="../concepts/search_view.html">Search view</a> for fulltext search of your items.</li>
	<li>Use the <a href="../concepts/bookmark_view.html">Bookmarks view</a> to show the special list of work items.</li>
	<li>The <a href="../concepts/last_changes_view.html">Last Changes view</a> shows the list of last created and last edited items respectively.</li>
</ul>
</p>
