        <abstract> Academic libraries need to change their recruiting and hiring procedures to stay
            competitive in today's changing marketplace. By taking too long to find and to hire
            talented professionals in a tight labor market, academic libraries are losing out on top
            candidates and limiting their ability to become innovative and dynamic organizations.
            Traditional, deliberate, and risk-averse hiring models lead to positions remaining open
            for long periods, opportunities lost as top prospects find other positions, and a
            reduction in the overall talent level of the organization. To be more competitive and
            effective in their recruitment and hiring processes, academic libraries must foster
            manageable internal solutions, look to other professions for effective hiring techniques
            and models, and employ innovative concepts from modern personnel management literature. </abstract>
